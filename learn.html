                   <h3>Data and DH: critical reading of Miriam Posner's article <em>What’s Next: The Radical, Unrealized Potential of 
			  Digital Humanities</em>, 2015</h3> 
                 <span>1st of October 2018</span>
		     <p>
                 <a href="http://miriamposner.com/blog/whats-next-the-radical-unrealized-potential-of-digital-humanities/" target="_blank">What’s Next: The Radical, Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanitie</a> arises a very much relevant question which I’d dare to resume as being this, of use of categories within data analysis in digital humanities’ field. 
                     But, paying more attention to reading, we can distinguish two parallel, yet different, discussed problems: the first one, about “contamination” of data’s collecting and consideration by common bias (such about gender, race, etc). The second is rather about visualization as consequence of biased analysis. <br>
                     <br>Former one is a rhetoric axis of article: the author indicates, very apropos, that the categories we manipulate and we convey to algorithms are profoundly impacted by paradigms about race, gender etc. in which author sees the hand of “power”. We understand then that DH researchers are viewed as having the capacity to stay mere from influence of “power” and their role is those of watchdog for equal treatment in the field of big data related to human (so to say, to pretty all data). We can suppose, reading the article that the position of DH researches is a particular one as standing outside of “business” (indeed, author blames all data analysis tools as being issued from and for business interests). The flame of advocacy of the author deserves a respect. Moreover, the problem of “contamination” of AI by our humain bias is raised as more often, as more large responsibilities (going up to court’s decisions and medical diagnosis) we entrust to AI. But in the world of relativeness there is no “mere place”: we’re all involved in paradigm’s lifespans and what we believe is good and progressive from our point of view is not necessary from another’s one. And the question is not to abandon the struggle for “objectivation” of data categorisation neither for more equal world and science about it. The question is, at least in the field of human culture, to appreciate the limits of all categories’ system and to include the knowledge about those limits into the global picture. <br>
                 One of the last article of founder of Cultural analytics’ approach, Lev Manovich, evokes, <a href="http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/can-we-think-without-categories" target="_blank">discussing the question of categories at their usefulness</a>, the pathway taken by Bourdieu in his <em>Distinction</em> (1979), based on <em>correspondence analysis</em>, developed decade before by Herman Otto Hartley. Data analysis, in the broader field of humanities, is not an aim in itself: it is exploratory analysis which is not supposed to generate numbers and formulas about human existence and culture.The exploratory analysis in the field of DH needs to focus on four main characteristics, underlined by Manovich: <em>diversity, structure</em> (networks and other types of relations), <em>dynamics</em> and <em>variability</em>. Thus, the tendance of reduction to categories (gender’s ones, if we take the example of Miriam Posner) must be a part of explorable field, not the departure of “sanction” about wrong or right way to categorise. We need to rely all the clusters to get an <em>overview effect</em> (and thus, step to a new stage of cognitive process), not a judgment. The final Posner’s reflexion involving a film sequence is, I believe, sourced from this intuition (still it is not obvious to link directly a film creation and data analysis).<br><br>
                     
                 From another side, the mention about “contaminated” data tools is worth to be discussed as it leads to a scary evidence that the closer we are to the source of algorithms, otherwise speaking, the more we can, as humanists,  be present at the root of digitalisation and digital analysis of big data, the more likely we can pretend on the role of “objectivity' regulators”. And here is, in my opinion, the open question about real competencies of DH (researcher). If DH is a field of <em>humanists</em> (I leave the sens of this terme to float between “continental” and “anglo-saxon” understandings) who only know <em>about</em> already developed  (for and by business) digital tools, the “struggle” risks always finish in rhetoric flames. That is: we do need the knowledge <em>of digital</em>, not <em>about</em> digital. The ethic of hackers (let’s call them “good” hackers, and I hope there is no confusion about this, somewhat blurry, defintion) is probably the same Myriam Posner tends to. With a difference that (good) hackers could have a real impact on the control of our digital world (forgive me, please, my optimism) and a (good) DH research, ignoring programming, stays an arbiter out of game. It is the reason why, I believe, the question, intuitively appointed in Posner’s article which is relevant up to now, is those, of the balance between “what we think” and “what we can”.<br><br>
                     
                     Another (last) problematic, arisen in article, related to data viz, is much more tangible. Still the affirmation that pretty all data visualizations “look terrifyingly authoritative” sounds little bit bombastic. While we understand the aim of criticism, what would be the “right solution” according to author? Surprisingly, only one data viz is offered as “good” exemple (and those, which seems to be really interesting, Evan Bissell and Erik Loyer's one, <em>The Knotted Line</em> is inaccessible), and it is difficult to agree that the <em>Data-izing the images: Process and Prototype</em> by David Kim is persuasive as we struggle even to read it and “overview effect” is just fluffed.
                     
                     I agree with affirmation that there is a kind of <em>cul de sac</em> with “traditional” tools of data viz. But today (3 years after the discussed article was published) some things happened. Diverse programming libraries (like D3.js) are more and more used for create the visions of <a href="https://123data.paris/collection">data on a broad with art</a>. <br>
                 One of brigthest examples, an approach developed by Giorgia Lupi along with her breathtaking data visualizations, is situated in this more and more broad tendance. This Italian informational designer working currently in New-York, advocates for <a href="http://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold/"> Data Humanism</a> speaks about “second wave” of data visualization which will be “about personalisation”. 
                     
                     Giorgia Lupi’s work and reflection create another pathway to a new cognitive paradigm which separates “understanding” from “interpretation” (using the terms of Susan Sontag in her “Against Intrepretation”). The new, human approach to data is indissociable from understanding by doing, from sharing this “doing” in what we call <em>interactivity</em>. And it is where I, personnally, see a full realisation of both of “Digital” and “Humanities”.

			<h3>Digitization. What for?</h3>
			<span>15th of October 2018</span>
		<p>	

		I'd like to bring to th discussion the article of Lev Manovich <a href = “http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/cultural-data” target = “blank”>Cultural Data: Possibilities and Limitations of Digitized Archives </a> 
		published last year.     
<br><br>
		Lev Manovich, founder of Cultural Analytics approach and name not to be missed in the field of Digital 
		Humanities. In this article, published last year, he describes, throught his researcher's experince, 
		the state of  digitizing of cultural data, from its beginning with Gutemberg project in 1970' up to 
		largest projects like Europeana which counted, in 2016, over 53 milion “artworks, artefacts, books, 
		videos, and sounds from across Europe.” 
<br><br>
		Manovich explains that, while the process of digitizing and dissimination seems to be as “covering” 
		as possible up to nowdays, those large collections (as mentionned below Europeana) still seem as a 
		“patchwork” of very heterogenic elements with no standartised size, extentions, classifications etc. 
		While obviously challenging for the use of this data, especially in the domain of data analytics and 
		machine learning, this challenge is must be seen as opportunity:
<br>
		<em>“It forces us to face the human visual culture as it really exists historically – thousands of 
		variations and their combinations, rather a net set of a small number of categories.”</em>
<br><br>
		Author also notices that while the process of digitatalisation expands in geometrical progression, 
		“the most basic question for any quantiative study of cultural history remains unaddressed”. 
		This question is, for him, those, of representative sampling, this term being understood in the sens 
		of statistic sciences, as a smaller subset of the larger data. Manovich says that systematic approach 
		to data is largely adopted by natural and social sciences but not by humanities in whcih the research 
		“is still driven most by ideologies, rather than a balances samples”. I will not resume here the 
		argumentation of author and his very interseting interpretation of a statistic approach for humanities: 
		the article is quite short and worth to be read. I would point another question ensuing from it. 
<br><br>
		We keep disscussing, on our Master's core modules, Data Humanities as gathering, digitizing and dissiminating 
		of data. The question is: what for? “To do it accessible” would not be an answer, or be a very incomplete one.
		Because answering so, we stick with a paradigm of quantity or, on a stage “in between” where “available” 
		calls a question: what for? So, what for, beside the joy of heritage officers and researchers themselfs, 
		the cultural data exists and continues to grow? 
<br><br>

		As Manovich says in introduction, digitization of cultural heritage over last two decades opened very 
		interesting possibilities. While the conversion of humans' artifacts in digital format is an endless 
		and obviously necessary process, the essential is now in the next steps. 
		I will not flood this post with the examples of the “next step” done in last years by hundreds DH researchers
		over the world. We don't need to go too far to get such an example: the presentation of his research by 
		Patrick Egan (musician, musicologue, web-developer) on a recent DH colloquium was a very bright one. 
		We need to admit that without get the hands dirty in such  “ennoying” things like data mining, analysis,
		programming languages and so on, we do “as if”. As if we were still somewhere in 2005 and a knowledge of 
		digital tools which allow gather and edit the data were a skyline. The reality is that thier mastering starts 
		to be a requirement for secondary level's school.. Moreover, those tools I call “facilitating” (as Zotero, 
		WordPress and similar) are not creative ones: they are done to comply to standards (of editing, publishing 
		etc), not to fertilize the research by decisively new possibilities offered today by data analysis and 
		visualization, machine learning and AI. Because there is a distinction, on my mind, between a researcher 
		in humanities who uses digital tools and digital humanities researcher.
<br><br>			
		The question is not at all in “personal orientation” and preferences. It is in realistic consideration of 
		the level of development and needs of a today post-digital world. Even if we can feel uncomfortable with it.

			<h3> Who's Afraid of Edmond Belamy? </h3>
			<h4> My contribution to the (somewhat absent form MA) digital art's topic </h4>
			 <span>28th of October 2018</span>
			<p>
			The news did a big tour in the medias, from Times to The Guardian: the “Baron of Belamy”, AI-generated artwork was sold, 
			on the 23rd of October, for the price of $432,000 on New York Christies auction, far from initial estimation of $7000 
			– 10000. Difficult to name the author : this artwork, which is  part of a series of many portraits (all of them sold 				since), is a result of a project of the young Parisian start-up named  “Obvious”, led by three young researchers/PhD 
			students/entrepreneurs: Pierre Fautrel, Hugo Caselles-Dupré and Gauthier Vernier. The Obvious exists since mid 2017 
			and represents this new wave of French start-ups flourishing on the very concentrated (in Paris, obviously) ground  
			of French  high-tech “new normals “. None of them has an art background but the medias already named them as “artists”. 
			Their credo is perfectly resumed in the title of a Medium article posted in June 2018: 
			<a href = "https://medium.com/@hello.obvious/a-naive-yet-educated-perspective-on-art-and-artificial-intelligence-9e16783e73da“ target = "blank"> 
			A naive yet educated perspective on Art and Artificial Intelligence".</a>
<br><br>			
			They explain the way Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), on the basis of series of  “Belamy family's” portraits, acts (the  “fake” family name is the tribute to GAN inventor,
			Ian Goodfellow, which, translated in French, but with english transcription, resulted in Bellamy). There is on one side a 
			generator, fed by data (15000 portraits form 15th up to 20th  century) and generating new images, and on the other side a 
			discriminator, a kind of “art-critic” indicating the level of “truth” in those new “fake” portraits. The Generator thus 
			produces new images, more and more “true” regarding the initial data. Nothing really new especially when we learn that 
			even the principle of using GAN for generative art doesn't belong to “Obvious” but was developed by 
			<a href = "https://github.com/robbiebarrat/art-DCGAN" target = "blank">Robbie Barrat </a> 
			and presented in an open source mode just before French start-uppers came across. Moreover, honestly 
			speaking, the result (Belamy's portraits) is nothing but one of the raw of AI creations and, from my personal point of view, 
			much less appealing than what we can see in Robbie Barrat's GitHub account. Not sure if it's  because of good marketing of 
			“made in France” brand, or because of troubling and vague similarity of Edmond Belamy with some artistic style, still 
			difficult to teas out, this one did break down the very symbolic barrier of art auctions.
<br><br>
			While generative art is not a very novelty, neither artificially generated artworks, we
			undoubtedly assist the new stage of what we can see as unavoidable process of machine/human “communion”. 
			Debates about the AI are omnipresent and hot. But it is precisely in art, on 
			of the first terrains of AI landing, that debates didn't seem to be such passionated so far. 
			<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AARON" target ="blank"> Aaron, a first program creating
			artworks algorithmically</a> is more than 40 years old. Processing, the open source 
			software which gave the  (relatively easy) access to generative art practice to thousands, 
			was created back to 2001. Since, the community of artists,  and  number of programs within 
			generative art's very large boundaries  don't stop to grow. And this resurgence of the debate 
			about computer-generated art on occasion of the first Christies sale (with relatively high 
			price) of “artificial” art work is interesting in itself, either by employed media rhetoric 
			as well as by this art-market's sensibility.  
<br><br>
			Indeed, we must wait for the “artificial” art work to be hung on the wall of Rockefeller center
			to read so 19th century declarations about <a href = " https://www.google.com/search?q=the+gaurdian+baron+of+belamy&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab“
			target = "blank"> "poor pastish of human genius" </a> and “art as a way humans communicate 
			ideas”.
<br><br>					

			Like in forecast of this reaction, in their article in Medium in last July, Obvious quote some 
			warnings,  sounding very contemporary but written around 1850 like “this discovery will 
			eliminate the inferior layers of art”. It was about new, by the time, photography. We now 
			know that not only photography did provoke the death of art but became itself a widely used 
			art practice. 
<br><br>
			Some decades later, appeared Dada and it seems like it wasn't unanimous about the question if the 
			collage made artifacts are within the art's boundaries or outside. What was Dada? One of the attempts
			to oppose the random paradigm to established ideology of art and remove the creation from a strict control of human cognitive planning (which, in the meaning of Dada artists, fully compromised itself in the absurdity of the World War). 
<br><br>
			It is quite interesting that Jonathan Jones, the author of the article in The Guardian, while stating
			about the art as  “human consciousness expressing itself” resorts, among others emblematic 
			examples, to ...Duchamp with his urinoir. Duchamp, from which we know the famous : 
			“That's the  onlookers who make the picture” and whose passion to make fun of and to fool all 
			rhetoric definition of art is well known, such as “the way to communicate the ideas” (what Mr Jones 
			believes the art is). 
<br><br>
			We can hang any definition on art, we will never tease out the thing which is, in essence, the way 
			to escape the rules of “normalized” thinking. The same about creativity, which is an inherent 
			component (or just another name?) of art. And we can observe, in art history, past and more recent, 
			numerous attempts to step outside of the zone of  human control and leave to the (widely understood)
			machine the part of creative process. It was and still is the same with photography or printing. 
			The novelty of Warhol's screen prints is based on the copy/past repetition and  the effect of 
			uncontrolled accidents of the printing process with its blunt “charm”. Are we really scandalized by
			his “I'd like to be a machine”, or just we can't figure out, until recently, that the “machine” 
			could be as scary and powerful as AI appears to us today and whose mission Jonathan Jones quotes 
			to be no less than the destruction of humanity?
<br><br>
			Answering the question if the AI will replace tomorrow an artist,  Obvious team responds by the 
			question: “Did the (photo) camera become the artist?” Of course, the camera, even becoming digital 
			(kind of AI,  in sum) is “encompassable” and “tamable”, while AI seems to escape to our understanding
			and enters more and more in a competition with human. Soon, the last bulwark, defended with so 
			obstinacy – the emotion, will no longer resist, as the “machine” will, in couple of years, as 
			promised, <a href = "https://hbr.org/2018/07/3-ways-ai-is-getting-more-emotional" target = "blank">
			understand better our emotions </a> than our (sometimes indifferent) relatives.
<br><br>
			Difficult to predict the future but what is quite sure, that the art remains, by any time, the 
			field of experimentations, not a secret garden where only highly conscious humans have a right 
			of entry. There is art in artificial (and Kunst in kunstlish, iskusstvo in iskusstvennyj 
			and sztuka in sztuchny)  as unpleasant as it could sound to somebody who believes that an artwork 
			is nothing but a very authentic picture of his creator's counsiousness. 
<br><br>
			One more evidence consists in the fact that there is no art without medium and the meaning of this 
			word overpasses those of tool. However, once trusted to the medium to define, even partially, 
			the output of his creative input, the humain tries to break down on every significant change in the 
			complexity of this medium. Scared that the medium will escape him? Apparently, today, this fear is 
			stronger than ever, but who can say, if more grounded?
