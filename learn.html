                   <h3>Data and DH: critical reading of Miriam Posner's article <em>What’s Next: The Radical, Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanities</em>, 2015</h3> 
                 <span>1st of October 2018</span><p>
                 <a href="http://miriamposner.com/blog/whats-next-the-radical-unrealized-potential-of-digital-humanities/" target="_blank">What’s Next: The Radical, Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanitie</a> arises a very much relevant question which I’d dare to resume it as being these of use of categories within data analysis in digital humanities’ field. 
                     But, paying more attention to reading, we can distinguish two parallel, yet different, discussed problems: the first one, of limits of all simplified data visualisation, and the other one, about “contamination” of data’s collecting and consideration by common bias (such about gender, race, etc). The second one is rather about visualization as consequence of biased analysis. <br>
                     Last one is a rhetoric axis of article: the author indicates, very apropos, that the categories we manipulate and we convey to algorithms are profoundly impacted by paradigms about race, gender etc. in which author sees the hand of “power”. We understand then that DH researchers are viewed as having the capacity to stay mere from influence of “power” and their role is those of watchdog for equal treatment in the field of big data related to human (so to say, to pretty all data). We can suppose, reading the article that the position of DH researches is a particular one as standing outside of “business” (indeed, author blames all data analysis tools as being issued from and for business interests). The flame of advocacy of the author deserves a respect. Moreover, the problem of “contamination” of AI by our humain bias is raised as more often, as more large responsibilities (going up to court’s decisions and medical diagnosis) we entrust to AI. But in the world of relativeness there is no “mere place”: we’re all involved in paradigm’s lifespans and what we believe is good and progressive from our point of view is not necessary from another’s one. And the question is not to abandon the struggle for “objectivation” of data categorisation neither for more equal world and science about it. The question is, at least in the field of human culture, to appreciate the limits of all categories’ system and to include the knowledge about those limits into the global picture. <br>
                 One of the last article of founder of Cultural analytics’ approach, Lev Manovich, evokes, <a href="http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/can-we-think-without-categories" target="_blank">discussing the question of categories at their usefulness</a>, the pathway taken by Bourdieu in his <em>Distinction</em> (1979), based on <em>correspondence analysis</em>, developed decade before by Herman Otto Hartley. Data analysis, in the broader field of humanities, is not an aim in itself: it is exploratory analysis which is not supposed to generate numbers and formulas about human existence and culture.The exploratory analysis in the field of DH needs to focus on four main characteristics, underlined by Manovich: <em>diversity, structure</em> (networks and other types of relations), <em>dynamics</em> and <em>variability</em>. Thus, the tendance of reduction to categories (gender’s ones, if we take the example of Miriam Posner) must be a part of explorable field, not the departure of “sanction” about wrong or right way to categorise. We need to rely all the clusters to get an <em>overview effect</em> (and thus, step to a new stage of cognitive process), not a judgment. The final Posner’s reflexion involving a film sequence is, I believe, sourced from this intuition (still it is not obvious to link directly a film creation and data analysis).<br><br>
                     
                 From another side, the mention about “contaminated” data tools is worth to be discussed as it leads to a scary evidence that the closer we are to the source of algorithms, otherwise speaking, the more we can, as humanists,  be present at the root of digitalisation and digital analysis of big data, the more likely we can pretend on the role of “objectivity' regulators”. And here is, in my opinion, the open question about real competencies of DH (researcher). If DH is a field of <em>humanists</em> (I leave the sens of this terme to float between “continental” and “anglo-saxon” understandings) who only know <em>about</em> already developed  (for and by business) digital tools, the “struggle” risks always finish in rhetoric flames. That is: we do need the knowledge <em>of digital</em>, not <em>about</em> digital. The ethic of hackers (let’s call them “good” hackers, and I hope there is no confusion about this, somewhat blurry, defintion) is probably the same Myriam Posner tends to. With a difference that (good) hackers could have a real impact on the control of our digital world (forgive me, please, my optimism) and a (good) DH research, ignoring programming, stays an arbiter out of game. It is the reason why, I believe, the question, intuitively appointed in Posner’s article which is relevant up to now, is those, of the balance between “what we think” and “what we can”.<br><br>
                     
                     Another (last) problematic, arisen in article, related to data viz, is much more tangible. Still the affirmation that pretty all data visualizations “look terrifyingly authoritative” sounds little bit bombastic. While we understand the aim of criticism, what would be the “right solution” according to author? Surprisingly, only one data viz is offered as “good” exemple (and those, which seems to be really interesting, Evan Bissell and Erik Loyer's one, <em>The Knotted Line</em> is inaccessible), and it is difficult to agree that the <em>Data-izing the images: Process and Prototype</em> by David Kim is persuasive as we struggle even to read it and “overview effect” is just fluffed.
                     
                     I agree with affirmation that there is a kind of <em>cul de sac</em> with “traditional” tools of data viz. But today (3 years after the discussed article was published) some things happened. Last generation creative tools (like D3.js library) are more and more used for create the visions of <a href="https://123data.paris/collection">data on a broad with art</a>. <br>
                 One of brigthest examples, an approach developed by Giorgia Lupi along with her breathtaking data visualizations, is situated in this more and more broad tendance. This Italian informational designer working currently in New-York, advocating for <a href="http://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold/"> Data Humanism</a> speaks about “second wave” of data visualization which will be “about personalisation”. 
                     
                     Giorgia Lupi’s work and reflection create another pathway to a new cognitive paradigm which separates “understanding” from “interpretation” (using the terms of Susan Sontag in her “Against Intrepretation”). The new, human approach to data is indissociable from understanding by doing, from sharing this “doing” in what we call <em>interactivity</em>. And it is where I, personnally, see a full realisation of both of “Digital” and “Humanities”.
